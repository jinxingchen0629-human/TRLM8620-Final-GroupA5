# TRLM8620-Final

Intergalactic Shopping Website – Team Project
Welcome to our localized intergalactic shopping website!
This project was developed as part of our final assignment for TRLM8620: Software Internationalization and Localization.
Our goal was to internationalize and localize a sci-fi themed e-commerce platform so that it can properly support multiple languages and culturally appropriate displays.

During development, we identified and resolved several key internationalization issues, including hard-coded strings, content fragmentation, non-global date formatting, and incorrect currency formatting. After restructuring the code and implementing i18n best practices, we successfully localized the website into Traditional Chinese and built a workflow that can accommodate additional languages in the future.

Working on this project gave our team very useful experience with internationalization. At the beginning, the setup was not easy. We needed to install GitHub Desktop, connect the repository, and learn how to use the workflow. Because we do not come from a technical background, these steps took us quite a lot of time. After everything was ready, our teamwork became smoother. Visual Studio Code and GitHub Desktop helped us work on our own computers and upload our changes without confusion. It made the collaboration more simple for everyone.

During this project, we also learned how important internationalization preparation is. After we corrected all the problems in the code, the translation to Traditional Chinese was extremely fast. It took less than five minutes to complete the first version of the Chinese interface. This experience showed us that when the codebase is organized well, localization becomes very efficient and easier to maintain. Even though we are not engineers, this project helped us understand how engineering and translation must work together. We believe that in our next project, our team will be more confident and more efficient.
